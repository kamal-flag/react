- Let's start by writing pure React. No compile step. No JSX. No Babel. No Webpack or Parcel. Just some JavaScript on a page.

- We can use html:5 in VS code to generate an html backbone

- We use 2 librairies React and React-DOM (to render into the dom)

- To develop mobile app we can use react-native instead of react-dom

- If we give to a React.createElement() method a String it will print a tag, but if we give it a component like App, it will analyse the component and render his tree

- JSX calls React.createElement() for you

- We use React, because is light wweight

- IMPORTANT CONCEPT in REACT : one way data flow :

In React JS, data flows in one direction, from Parent to Child. This helps components to be simple and predictable.
